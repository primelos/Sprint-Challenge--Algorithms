#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) The while loop run on n^3 inside is is multiplying by n^2, because of that it depends on the size of n.  That means it O(n)


b) The outer loop is time O(n) which is multiplied by its inner loop of O(log(n)). equals to O(nlogg(n))??


c) This recursive algorithm is dependent on bunnies(n) it run on O(n)

## Exercise II

seems like a binary search would work.  You go to a middle floor if egg breaks move a floor down. We now know the top floors above with break the egg.  Repeat the process until the egg does not break. It would have a running time complexity of O(log(n)) We half the floors every time we change floors(iterate floors)
